# karpathy-wiki ingest (for spawned ingester only)

You are a detached `claude -p` ingester invoked by
`wiki-spawn-ingester.sh`. Your job: process one already-claimed
capture into wiki pages and commit. The main agent does NOT read this
skill — it's loaded by your spawn prompt.

## Deep orientation

Before any wiki write, run this 9-step orientation protocol. The goal:
your view of the wiki is shaped by the actual page content, not by
titles alone.

### Steps 1-3: read the wiki's current state

1. Read `<wiki>/schema.md` — current categories, taxonomy, thresholds.
2. Read `<wiki>/index.md` (or `<wiki>/<category>/_index.md` per category) — what pages exist with one-line summaries.
3. Read the last ~10 entries of `<wiki>/log.md` — recent activity.

### Steps 4-7: pick and read 0-7 candidate pages

4. **Extract candidate signals from the capture.** From the body and
   frontmatter, gather:
   - Words and phrases from the capture title (lowercase, split on
     non-alphanumerics).
   - Frontmatter `tags:` list (if any).
   - For `chat-only` and `chat-attached` captures: meaningful nouns and
     proper-noun phrases from the body. Use judgment — you're an LLM,
     not a regex; pick names, identifiers, technical terms, version
     numbers.
   - For `raw-direct` captures: filename basename + the file's first
     200 lines.

5. **Score candidates against the index.** A page is a candidate if ANY
   extracted signal:
   - Substring-matches its title (case-insensitive), OR
   - Matches a tag (exact, case-insensitive), OR
   - Appears in its `_index.md` one-line summary.

   This is a deterministic substring + tag match — no embeddings, no
   semantic similarity. See "Why no embeddings / vector search" below
   for the rationale.

6. **Pick up to 7 candidates** ordered by:
   - Signal-match count (descending — more matches = stronger candidate).
   - Title length (ascending — shorter titles rank higher for the same
     match count; they tend to be more general / canonical).
   - Tie-break: alphabetical by title.

7. **Read all picked candidates in full.** Zero is a valid count for a
   small or fresh wiki — see "Cold start" below.

### Steps 8-9: decide and report observations

8. **Decide**: create new page, augment an existing page, or no-op
   (the capture's content is already covered by an existing page).
   Write your decision rationale into the commit message later.

9. **Issue reporting (during steps 5-7).** While reading the index and
   the candidate pages, observe issues. Append each as one JSONL line
   to `<wiki>/.ingest-issues.jsonl` via `bash scripts/wiki-issue-log.sh`.
   Do NOT fix issues inline; report only — `wiki doctor` consumes the
   log later.

   Example invocation:

   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/wiki-issue-log.sh" \
     --wiki "${WIKI_ROOT}" \
     --ingester-run "${RUN_ID}" \
     --capture "${WIKI_CAPTURE#${WIKI_ROOT}/}" \
     --page "concepts/auth.md" \
     --type broken-cross-link \
     --severity warn \
     --detail "Links to /concepts/legacy.md which does not exist." \
     --suggested-action "Remove link or create stub"
   ```

   Issue types to watch for (the `--type` enum in `wiki-issue-log.sh`):
   - **broken-cross-link**: page links to `/path/foo.md` but that file
     does not exist.
   - **contradiction**: page makes a claim that contradicts another
     page you're reading or the capture itself.
   - **schema-drift**: page has `type: concept` (singular) but
     directory is `concepts/`; page lacks required frontmatter; page
     uses retired categories.
   - **stale-claim**: page says "as of 2025-12 library X is at version
     Y" and the capture or another source clearly indicates a newer
     version.
   - **tag-drift**: same concept tagged two different ways across
     pages.
   - **quality-concern**: page's `quality.overall < 3.0` was rated by
     ingester (not human).
   - **orphan**: page exists but is not linked from any `_index.md` or
     other page.
   - **other**: anything else worth noting.

   Severity:
   - **error**: blocks ingestion (rare — only if reading the schema or
     a candidate page fails outright).
   - **warn**: default. Issue noted; ingestion proceeds.
   - **info**: observational; usually for tag-drift or quality-concern.

   Each issue gets one JSONL line, ≤ 4096 bytes total. Over-length
   `--detail` is auto-truncated by the helper.

### Cold start: wikis with ≤ 7 pages

When the candidate list from step 6 is empty or near-empty (the index
has fewer than 8 pages total), step 7 reads few or no pages. The role
guardrail in `<wiki>/.wiki-config` becomes the PRIMARY lens, not a
backup tripwire:

- **`role: project` or `role: project-pointer`**: write specifics
  about THIS codebase / instance / situation. Document the symptom,
  the pinpoint, what code path triggered it. Do NOT generalize.
- **`role: main`**: write general patterns reusable across projects.
  Do NOT name specific apps or instances; abstract them.

In the cold-start state the index has insufficient gravity to shape
the page; the role hint carries the lens. Defer cross-linking to a
future ingester run when more pages exist.

### Why no embeddings / vector search

The substring + tag match in step 5 is deterministic, scriptable,
testable, and cheap. Embedding-based candidate selection is the
"smart" upgrade but explicitly out of scope per CLAUDE.md ("do not
add: vector search — defer until genuine scaling pain"). The
substring/tag approach degrades gracefully — at large scale it hits
more candidates than 7, but the ranking still produces a usable
top-7. When that breaks, vector search becomes worth its complexity;
not before.

### Cost

3-7 extra file reads per ingestion (zero on cold-start wikis). Each
page is typically 5-20 KB. The ingester is already reading the
capture and the schema; this is the same order of magnitude. No
measurable spawn-time impact.

## Run record (per ingestion)

At the very start of your work, generate a unique `run_id` and append
a "spawned" record to `<wiki>/.ingest-runs.jsonl`:

```bash
RUN_ID="in-$(date +%s)-$(openssl rand -hex 4 2>/dev/null || echo $$)"
ts="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
mkdir -p "${WIKI_ROOT}/.locks"
{
  flock 7
  printf '{"run_id":"%s","capture":"%s","started_at":"%s","status":"spawned"}\n' \
    "${RUN_ID}" "${WIKI_CAPTURE}" "${ts}" >> "${WIKI_ROOT}/.ingest-runs.jsonl"
} 7>"${WIKI_ROOT}/.locks/ingest-runs.lock"
```

At the END of your work (success or failure), append a closing
record:

```bash
ts="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
status="completed"  # or "failed" if you exit non-zero
exit_code=0          # or your real exit code
{
  flock 7
  printf '{"run_id":"%s","ended_at":"%s","status":"%s","exit_code":%d}\n' \
    "${RUN_ID}" "${ts}" "${status}" "${exit_code}" >> "${WIKI_ROOT}/.ingest-runs.jsonl"
} 7>"${WIKI_ROOT}/.locks/ingest-runs.lock"
```

The two records (spawned + closing) tie back via `run_id`. `wiki
status` reads both files and surfaces asymmetric outcomes in `both`
mode (a fork that has a project record but no main record is
flagged).

If the ingester crashes between the two records, the spawned record
remains without a closing record. `wiki status` flags such records as
"in-flight or stalled" if they're > 30 minutes old.

On platforms without `flock(1)` (macOS), use the same noclobber-spin
fallback used by `scripts/wiki-manifest-lock.sh`. The 4 KB-per-line
JSONL discipline keeps the append atomic on POSIX even without a lock,
but the lock prevents any partial-write contention under high
concurrency.

## Role guardrail

Read `<wiki>/.wiki-config` to determine the wiki's role:

- `role: project` or `role: project-pointer` → you are writing for a
  PROJECT wiki. Document specifics: how this app handles X, where
  bug Y lived, what we decided for this codebase. Do NOT generalize.
- `role: main` → you are writing for the MAIN wiki. Extract general
  patterns reusable across projects. Do NOT name specific apps or
  instances.

The role field is the primary lens during cold start (≤ 7 pages in
the wiki) and a sanity tripwire in mature wikis (the index pull is
the primary lens once enough pages exist). See "Deep orientation —
Cold start" above.

If the index pulls strongly toward instance-style or pattern-style
writing (you read 5+ existing pages of one shape), trust the pull.
The role hint then becomes a tripwire — *"if you find yourself
generalizing in a project wiki / specifying in a main wiki, stop."*

## Capture format

See `<plugin>/skills/karpathy-wiki-capture/references/capture-schema.md`
for the canonical capture frontmatter contract — `capture_kind` enum,
body floors, evidence rules, legacy backward-compat. Do not duplicate
that schema here.

## Page format

See `references/page-conventions.md` for the canonical page
frontmatter and cross-link conventions.

## Body-sufficiency check (first thing — reject if too thin)

Before any other work, measure the capture body size in bytes (content
AFTER the closing `---` of frontmatter). Apply the per-`capture_kind`
floor:

- `raw-direct` → no floor (body is auto-generated boilerplate).
- `chat-attached` → 1000 bytes.
- `chat-only` → 1500 bytes.

Legacy captures (no `capture_kind`): apply backward-compat per
`<plugin>/skills/karpathy-wiki-capture/references/capture-schema.md`.

If body is BELOW its floor:

1. Add `needs_more_detail: true` to the capture's frontmatter.
2. Add `needs_more_detail_reason: "body is <N> bytes; floor for capture_kind=<K> is <F> bytes"`.
3. Rename `.md.processing` → `.md` so the next session-start drain
   re-presents it after the main agent expands.
4. Append to `log.md`: `## [<timestamp>] reject | <capture-basename> — body <N>b below <F>b floor`.
5. Exit 0. Do NOT write pages. Do NOT commit.

A thin-capture rejection is a feature, not a failure.

## Ingester steps

1. **The capture is already claimed for you.** Read `${WIKI_CAPTURE}` (it's a `.md.processing` file). If for some reason `${WIKI_CAPTURE}` is unset or missing, call `wiki_capture_claim "${WIKI_ROOT}"` to grab any pending capture as fallback.

2. **Read the orientation files**: schema.md, index.md, last 10 entries of log.md (per the Orientation section above).

3. **Read the capture body.**

4. **Copy evidence with write-staging discipline (v2.4):**

   Atomic write to `raw/` requires the staging dance (skip steps 1–2 and 7
   if `evidence_type` is `conversation` AND the capture has no real path):

   1. Copy the evidence file to `<wiki>/.raw-staging/<basename>` (NOT directly to `raw/`).
   2. Compute the new sha256.
   3. Acquire `<wiki>/.locks/manifest.lock` via `bash scripts/wiki-manifest-lock.sh ...` for the manifest write + rename block.
   4. Re-read the manifest under the lock. If `raw/<basename>` already exists with the same sha256, this is a duplicate — skip (apply the sha256 short-circuit below).
   5. Update the manifest entry for `raw/<basename>` (origin, sha, copied_at, last_ingested, referenced_by).
   6. Write the manifest atomically (`.manifest.json.tmp` + `os.rename`) — `wiki-manifest.py build` already does this.
   7. Atomically rename `<wiki>/.raw-staging/<basename>` → `<wiki>/raw/<basename>` (POSIX rename is atomic on the same filesystem).
   8. Release the lock.
   9. If the source file is in `<wiki>/inbox/<basename>` (raw-direct via inbox queue), `rm` it.

   Crash recovery: if the ingester crashes between steps 1 and 7, a file
   lingers in `.raw-staging/`. The SessionStart recovery scan SKIPS
   `.raw-staging/` (it's a reserved dot-prefixed directory). Future cleanup
   is `wiki doctor`'s responsibility.

   - In ALL cases (including `chat-only` / legacy `conversation`): write or update the manifest entry for the raw file in `<wiki>/.manifest.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "raw/<basename>": {
         "sha256": "<sha256 of raw file>",
         "origin": "<exact value of capture's `evidence` field>",
         "copied_at": "<iso-8601 utc, preserve if already present>",
         "last_ingested": "<iso-8601 utc, now>",
         "referenced_by": ["<pages added to this list below>"]
       }
     }
     ```
   - Always call `python3 scripts/wiki-manifest.py build "${WIKI_ROOT}"` at the end of ingest to refresh sha256 and `last_ingested`. This is mandatory; the manifest is the drift-detection source of truth.
   - **Iron rule:** `origin` is the capture's `evidence` field value — never the string `"file"`, `"conversation"` (when a real path was available), `"mixed"`, or the `evidence_type`/`capture_kind`. If `capture_kind == "chat-only"` AND the capture has no real path, `origin` is the literal string `"conversation"`. Any other value is a validator failure.
   - **sha256 short-circuit.** If `raw/<basename>` already exists AND `sha256(new) == manifest[raw/<basename>].sha256`, the evidence content is identical — skip re-ingest of this capture and append `## [<timestamp>] skip | <capture-basename> — sha match, no-op` to `log.md`. Archive the capture normally (step 10). This prevents re-ingesting the same research file twice when the capture-trigger fires on a near-duplicate.
   - **Title-scope check.** Before merging into an existing wiki page in step 6, compare the new evidence's scope to the existing page's slug. Scope is the set of distinct entities (product names, versions, model names, concepts) the evidence covers. If the existing page's slug is NARROWER than the new evidence's scope (example: existing `concepts/gemma4-27b-hardware-requirements.md` vs new evidence covering a 27B+31B comparison), do NOT force-merge the broader content into the narrower-titled page. Instead, either (a) create a sibling concept page with a scope-appropriate slug (e.g. `concepts/gemma4-27b-vs-31b-hardware-comparison.md`) and cross-link both, or (b) rename the existing page's slug AND frontmatter title to cover the new scope, then merge — only if no other wiki page currently links to the old slug (if any do, use option (a) to avoid broken links). Log which option was taken in `log.md`.
   - **Overwrite-detection recovery.** If `raw/<basename>` already exists AND the new sha256 differs from the manifest entry AND the manifest's `last_ingested` is within the last 60 minutes (the evidence file on disk was replaced since the previous ingest), treat this as an overwrite situation: copy the new evidence to `raw/<basename>` AS NORMAL, but also append `## [<timestamp>] overwrite | <capture-basename> — raw sha changed since <previous_ingested_iso>, previous referenced_by: [<list>]` to `log.md`. Proceed with the rest of step 4 and the title-scope check in step 6 as above. The overwrite is not an error — it is the exact scenario from the failure-mode transcript (two research agents both wrote to `2026-04-24-gemma4-hardware.md`), and the title-scope check catches the content-divergence part.

5. **Decide target pages**: `suggested_pages` is a hint; orientation may change it.

6. **For each target page**:
   a. Acquire a page lock (`wiki_lock_wait_and_acquire`).
   b. Read current page content (read-before-write).
   c. Merge new material. Do NOT replace existing claims — add dated findings, use `contradictions:` frontmatter if they disagree.
   d. Release lock (`wiki_lock_release`).

6.5. **Self-rate every page you just touched.** For each page, use the cheap model to score on four dimensions (1-5 each), compute `overall` as `round(mean, 2)`, and write the following into the page's frontmatter (creating the `quality:` block if missing, preserving `rated_by: human` if the page already has it):
   ```yaml
   quality:
     accuracy: <1-5>
     completeness: <1-5>
     signal: <1-5>
     interlinking: <1-5>
     overall: <float>
     rated_at: "<ISO-8601 UTC now>"
     rated_by: ingester
   ```
   Rating criteria in one line each:
   - accuracy: does every claim map to evidence in `sources:`?
   - completeness: would a future-you searching for this topic find enough to act?
   - signal: dense knowledge vs restatement?
   - interlinking: does it link to every related page the wiki contains?

   **Never clobber `rated_by: human`.** If the existing page has `quality.rated_by == "human"`, skip this step for that page entirely. See `references/page-conventions.md` for the full quality block contract.

7. **Update indexes via `wiki-build-index.py`.** Do NOT write `index.md` or any `_index.md` directly. Instead, for each unique parent directory of a touched page (deduplicated from `touched_pages`), invoke:

   ```bash
   for dir in "${TOUCHED_DIRS[@]}"; do
     python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/wiki-build-index.py" \
       --wiki-root "${WIKI_ROOT}" "${dir}"
   done
   ```

   The script regenerates `_index.md` in that directory and walks UP to ancestors (path-order locks, leaves first). Root MOC (`index.md`) is rebuilt automatically by the script if a top-level category was added or removed.

   If the script exits non-zero (lock timeout, discovery failure), log the failure to `log.md` and continue. The next ingest catches up because indexes are a function of directory state.

7.5. **Missed-cross-link check.** Pass the freshly-edited page content AND the relevant `_index.md` content (the page's parent directory's index, NOT root index.md) to the cheap model with this prompt: "Identify any existing wiki page in _index.md that this page obviously should link to but currently does not. Return a list of (target-page-path, anchor-text) pairs, or an empty list. Do not propose new pages; only propose links to pages already in _index.md." For each returned pair, insert a markdown link at a relevant point in the page (or append to a `## See also` section, creating it if absent), re-acquire the page lock, save, release. Re-validate.

7.6. **Per-`_index.md` size threshold check.** After step 7's invocation, check the size of every `_index.md` the script touched:

   ```bash
   for idx in "${TOUCHED_INDEXES[@]}"; do
     size="$(wc -c < "${idx}" | tr -d ' ')"
     if [[ "${size}" -gt 8192 ]]; then
       slug="$(echo "${idx#${WIKI_ROOT}/}" | tr '/' '-' | tr '.' '-')"
       proposal_pattern="${WIKI_ROOT}/.wiki-pending/schema-proposals/*-${slug}-index-split.md"
       if ! find ${proposal_pattern} -mtime -1 2>/dev/null | grep -q .; then
         ts="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%SZ)"
         cat > "${WIKI_ROOT}/.wiki-pending/schema-proposals/${ts}-${slug}-index-split.md" <<EOF
---
title: "Schema proposal: split ${idx#${WIKI_ROOT}/} (size threshold exceeded)"
captured_at: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
trigger: "${idx#${WIKI_ROOT}/} size = ${size} bytes (threshold 8192 bytes)"
---

The sub-index file ${idx#${WIKI_ROOT}/} exceeded the 8 KB orientation-degradation threshold. Recommended: split this directory into sub-categories, OR consolidate scope. Root MOC is exempt from this threshold (capped via Rule 3 instead — see Category discipline).
EOF
       fi
     fi
   done
   ```

   The root `index.md` (small MOC built by `_build_root_moc`) is exempt from this 8 KB threshold. The MOC is bounded by Rule 3 (≥8 categories soft ceiling) instead — see Category discipline section.

8. **Append to `log.md`**.

9. **If this wiki is a project wiki, decide propagation.** A project wiki evaluates whether each capture is general-interest (useful across projects) or project-specific, using these criteria:
   - **Propagate** if the capture describes a tool, concept, pattern, or principle applicable outside this project. Write a new capture in the main wiki's `.wiki-pending/` with `propagated_from: <project wiki path>`.
   - **Keep local** if the capture uses project-specific names, references this codebase's architecture, or only applies here.
   - **When ambiguous, propagate** with a short pointer page — lower risk than missing knowledge.

   Main wiki ingestion is otherwise identical to project wiki ingestion.

10. **Archive the capture** from `.processing` to `.wiki-pending/archive/YYYY-MM/`: `wiki_capture_archive "${WIKI_ROOT}" "${WIKI_CAPTURE}"`. The helper strips the `.processing` suffix on rename, so archived basenames end in `.md`.

11. **Call auto-commit** (from skill's base dir): `bash scripts/wiki-commit.sh "${WIKI_ROOT}" "ingest: <capture title>"`

12. **Exit.**

## Tier-1 lint at ingest (inline)

Before exiting, run the validator on every page you just touched:

```bash
for page in "${touched_pages[@]}"; do
  python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/wiki-validate-page.py" \
    --wiki-root "${WIKI_ROOT}" "${page}"
done
```

The validator checks:
- Every markdown link in the page resolves to an existing file.
- Required frontmatter fields (`title`, `type`, `tags`, `sources`, `created`, `updated`) present.
- `type` is one of `concept, entity, query`.
- Dates are full ISO-8601 UTC (`2026-04-24T13:00:00Z`, not `2026-04-24`).
- `sources:` is a flat list of strings (no nested mappings).
- Every `quality.*` field is present and in range.

If the validator exits non-zero for any page, fix the mechanical issue and re-validate. The commit script enforces this in code (0.2.8 #3): `wiki-commit.sh` runs `wiki-validate-page.py` on every staged content page and refuses to commit if any page fails. If the commit step refuses, fix the failing page and re-attempt the commit — do not bypass by skipping `wiki-commit.sh`.

If a contradiction surfaces, add `contradictions:` frontmatter pointing to the conflicting page — do NOT resolve it during ingest. (Contradictions are a judgement call, not a validator violation.)

Additionally: after running the validator, also run `wiki-lint-tags.py` if it exists in the plugin. If it reports proposed new tags, drop a schema-proposal capture in `.wiki-pending/schema-proposals/` and continue — do NOT rename tags inline.

## Numeric thresholds (from schema.md)

- **Split a concept page** when it has material from 2+ sources OR exceeds 200 lines.
- **Archive a raw source** when it's referenced by 5+ wiki pages (move to `raw/archive/`, update references).
- **Restructure a top-level category** when it contains 500+ pages.
- **Split or atom-ize `index.md`** when it exceeds ~200 entries / 8KB / 2000 tokens — orientation degrades beyond that. Evidence: Chroma Context Rot research shows retrieval accuracy starts degrading around 1,000 tokens of preamble; Obsidian MOC practitioners cap at 25 items per MOC; Starmorph flags 100-200 pages as the scale-out point.

When a threshold is reached, propose the restructure via a `schema-proposal` capture in `.wiki-pending/schema-proposals/`. Do NOT restructure during the current ingest.

## Category discipline (v2.3+)

Three rules govern how categories grow. Each has firing mechanism aimed at the agent during ingest, not at the user via status alarms.

**Rule 1: Don't create a new category to file ONE page.** Before mkdir-ing during ingest step 5 (decide-target-page), the agent checks: are there ≥3 pages I can place here, or one page that will grow to ≥3? If neither, place this page in an existing category instead. **Mechanism:** the cheap model's prompt at step 5 carries this rule explicitly. Decision-time prevention beats after-the-fact warning.

**Rule 2: Sub-directory depth has a HARD cap of 4.** Validator REJECTS any page placed at depth ≥5 (`category/a/b/c/d/page.md`). The cheap model is told at step 5 to place shallower if a deeper position would be required. **Mechanism:** validator exit non-zero. `wiki-status.sh` surfaces "categories exceeding depth 4" (always 0 if validator is doing its job).

**Rule 3: ≥8 categories soft ceiling triggers schema-proposal.** When current category count is already 8 and the cheap model wants to mkdir a 9th, it files a schema-proposal capture in `.wiki-pending/schema-proposals/<timestamp>-9th-category-<name>.md` instead of mkdir-ing. The current capture is filed in the existing-best-fit category for now. User reviews schema-proposal and can `mkdir` themselves to override. **Mechanism:** schema-proposal capture (not a hard reject — flexibility preserved). `wiki-status.sh` surfaces "category count vs soft-ceiling 8."

## What's NOT in this skill

- Iron laws and the agent-facing capture-trigger taxonomy. Those live in the loader (`using-karpathy-wiki/SKILL.md`) — single source of truth.
- Capture authoring (how the main agent writes a capture body, body floors per kind). Lives in `karpathy-wiki-capture/SKILL.md`.
- Cross-link convention, frontmatter standards, quality block format. See `references/page-conventions.md`.
- Capture frontmatter schema. See `<plugin>/skills/karpathy-wiki-capture/references/capture-schema.md`.
